- Added enableScreenBulkDrop option (default: on), which allows holding shift while dropping an item out of the screen to drop all items of that type
- Changed the special controls to only trigger on left-clicks, resolving possible compatibility conflicts with mods adding special handling to right-clicks
- Fixed bulk transferring all items to the inventory resulting in items being reordered
